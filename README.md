# The Breakroom

## Description

The Breakroom is the perfect time-waster webpage for those slow days in the office. Click around and enjoy the wacky animations, truly funny jokes, intriguing fortunes, and master pong battle. 

This was our first project as part of the Columbia Unviersity Coding Bootcamp and we have all learned quite a bit about collaboration via the Agile workflow, Javascript, Materialize, and the inner workings of the internet (aka CSS and HTML).
